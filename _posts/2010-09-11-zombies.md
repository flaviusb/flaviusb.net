If the zombie world hypothesis is incorrect, then any sufficiently good model of a sentient being must itself be sentient.

That is to say, the bridging laws must be capturable within the character of physical law, so if physical law can be modelled, then our models themselves can...

This has horrifying consequences; every simulation which meets those criteria...

Epiphenomenalism vs direct religious revelation; both require privileged epistemic access to verify; inside vs outside display. Identical displays could be given by people who have or have not had either. _Unless_ one makes the posit that the same external behavior must result from the same internal state.
